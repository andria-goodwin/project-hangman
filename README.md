# Project Hangman

## Description

User Story:
As a bootcamp student
I want to play a game to take a break from studying
so that I do not throw my computer

We built this project to test our knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Now we have a website that showcases our combined knowledge and a really fun game to play in our passtimes. We learned how to read documentation to use an unfamiliar CSS framework. We also learned more about pulling information from APIs and applying it it a way that can be fun.

## Installation

You can click the letter buttons to guess the word. Wrong letters will turn red and correct letter will turn green and be added to the word.

You can also click the hint button in the upper left hand corner for a hint, but it warns you that you will use a strike if you do first.

When the game is over you will be presented with a Game Over modal where you can input your name to save your score. it will also tell you what the last word was.
